### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm [Hamutahl Cohen](https://hamutahlcohen.squarespace.com/)!

I'm an environmental scientist that uses data to better inform decision makers. I apply laboratory techniques, field observations, and data science to gain novel insight to conservation problems. I work on a variety of sustainability issues and collaborate closely with folks such as farmers, city planners, educators, and policy makers.
